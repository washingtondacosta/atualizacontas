#2 ABOUT DEVELOPED APPLICATION #

PHP programming language was used, along with the front end frameworks: Bootstrap v.3.3.7 and backend CodeIgniter v3.1.2, allied to the use of the style sheet markup language CSS 3, HTML5, plus the use of JQuery snippets. The layout of the application took into account the concept of mobile-first, already provided by the bootstrap framework, as well as a page layout through the grid system adopted by it. Making the system more adapted and adapted to the most varied resolution sizes. CodeIgniter used the MVC (Model-View-Controler) architecture standard for customer and invoice entities. The file with registers made by the system can be found inside the root directory of the data / registros.db application, like other main folders in mass applications (eg controllers, models and views).

Access to the system's main faculties is provided by viewing faturas / index such as: add, list, delete, edit. A view. 

#2.1.1 Features #

There were some features like invoice reporting, demonstrating the use of responsive features of the Bootstrap framework, no longer differentiable as those that are part of print time and as the information viewed on screen.

The client validated the project and thus met the expectations and requirements.
